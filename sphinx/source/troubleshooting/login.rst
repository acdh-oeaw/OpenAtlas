Login
=====

.. toctree::

Depending on the issue, please try the following solutions to log in.

Invalid user or password
------------------------

You have entered an incorrect password and/or the username doesn't exist
(anymore).

You can activate the **show password** checkbox to see the entered password
and make sure that the problem isn't keyboard related, e.g. if capslock is
turned on.

If email was configured at this instance you can request a new password by
clicking the **Forgot your password?** link. It is directly located underneath
the login button.

This user is not activated
--------------------------

Your user was deactivated. If you think this was done by mistake, please
contact your project manager.

Too many login attempts
-----------------------

For security reasons (e.g. automatic attacks) the login for a specific user
gets locked after a few failed attempts. The number of failed attempts and
minutes to wait until you can try again depend on project specific settings.
In case you can't try again after a few minutes, contact your project manager.
